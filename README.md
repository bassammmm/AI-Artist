AI-Artist is a computer program that uses a variant of Genetic Algorithm to imitate a real artist. This program uses a given image and then tries to sketch it using just 2 methods. It can either place a colored dot on the canvas, or it can paint a rectangle of any color. 

The algorithm keeps trying to sketch it to perfection and will need to be stopped at some point as it aims to sketch a perfect replica which may take some time :)
